# Discord Moderation Bot

## Project Overview

Developing a discord moderation bot to assist in managing a discord server efficiently.

## Features

- Automated moderation tools to detect and act on rule violations.
- Customizable moderation commands for muting, kicking, banning users.
- Logging of moderation actions for transparency and accountability.
- User-friendly dashboard for configuring bot settings and permissions.
- Scheduled messages for reminders, announcements, and events.
- Keyword filters to automatically delete or flag messages containing specific words.
- Anti-raid features to prevent mass-joining and spamming.
- Integration with third-party moderation services for enhanced security.
- Real-time monitoring of server activity and alerts for suspicious behavior.
- Automatic role assignment based on user behavior or activity.
- Customizable welcome messages for new users.
- Ability to create and manage custom commands for server members.
- In-depth analytics and reporting on server activity and trends.

## Enhancements

- Implement machine learning algorithms for more accurate content moderation.
- Integrate with APIs for additional features like weather updates, music streaming, or trivia games.
- Enhance user interface for a more intuitive and interactive experience.
- Implement a reputation system to reward positive user behavior and discourage violations.
- Add a ticketing system for users to report issues or seek assistance easily.

## Programming Languages

- Python for backend logic and discord bot functionality.
- JavaScript for frontend dashboard development.

## APIs
